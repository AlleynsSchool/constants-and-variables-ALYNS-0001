Question 1

CONSTANTS and variables
In this task, your job is to use the constants A = 5 & B = 7 and any
of the following operators (*, **, -, /, //, %) to generate a value
of 23 for variable c. This task is made more difficult by the following rules:

1. you cannot directly assign a value to c i.e. it is not legal to  say c = 1,
c must be assigned using A, B, c and any operator except +. So c = A/B would be legal; c = c * c would be legal.
2. No other variables or constants may be used other than those declared in the function below.
"""
def constantsAndVariables() -> int:
    A = 5
    B = 7
    c = A  # alter this line and add any others to generate a value
    # of 23 for c before the return statement (below). Make sure
    # your indentation matches the other constants (A & B) and variable (c)

    return 23


"""
Question 2
Use string handling functions (see textbook p.5) to determine the following
a)
the number of times the number of characters in the quote fit in to 23.
"""
def numTimesQuoteIn23() -> int:
    #write your code here and return the variable which stores the answer to question 2.a
    return 0# you are expected to replace this 0 return value.


"""
b)
the two numbers representing the start and the end indices of the substring "Now I am become Death, 
the destroyer of worlds" (excluding the quote marks) - to help you check your answer you might choose to
use those numbers to see if you can extract the substring from the quote. This can be done using Python 
syntax: Quote[0:10] would, for instance, return the string: "A few peop" - use the test space below to 
try this out.
